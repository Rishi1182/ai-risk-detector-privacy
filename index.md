# Privacy Policy – Sentinel Gate

**Last updated: 29 January 2026**

Sentinel Gate is a browser extension designed to help users assess the risk of AI-generated content, phishing attempts, impersonation, and coordinated scam campaigns by analyzing user-requested website content.

---

## Data Collection

Sentinel Gate does **not** collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, passwords, payment details, authentication credentials, or precise location data.

The extension processes **website content only**, including visible page text and links, **solely when the user explicitly initiates an analysis** (for example, by selecting text, scanning a page, or using the extension interface).

Sentinel Gate does **not** monitor browsing activity in the background.

---

## Data Usage

The selected website content is transmitted to a remote analysis service exclusively to perform risk analysis and return results to the user.

The data is used only to:
- assess content risk signals (such as AI-style indicators or link safety), and
- identify potential campaign-level patterns when enabled by the user.

The data is **not** used for advertising, tracking, profiling, or marketing purposes.

---

## Campaign Detection & Fingerprinting

When the Campaign Detection feature is enabled, Sentinel Gate may generate **anonymized style fingerprints** derived from analyzed content. These fingerprints are:
- generated from writing patterns, not raw text,
- anonymized and non-reversible,
- used only to help identify potential coordinated scam patterns.

Campaign detection data may include anonymized style hashes, coarse domain indicators, and timestamps. This data is retained for a limited period (for example, up to 48 hours) and is **never associated with personal identities**.

Users can opt out of contributing anonymized campaign data at any time via the Settings tab.

---

## Data Storage

Sentinel Gate may store analysis results, fingerprints, and user preferences **locally on the user’s device** using browser storage. This allows users to:
- review recent scans,
- compare writing styles across their own analyses, and
- maintain extension settings.

No personal data is stored remotely by the extension.

---

## User Control & Data Deletion

All analysis actions are initiated by the user.

Users can delete all locally stored Sentinel Gate data at any time using the **“Delete all data”** option in the Settings tab. This clears stored analysis results, fingerprints, and preferences from the device.

---

## Data Sharing

Sentinel Gate does **not** sell user data.

Data is not shared with third parties except as required to perform the requested analysis via the extension’s backend service.

---

## Remote Services

The extension communicates with a backend API to process analysis requests and return non-executable results.

No executable code is loaded remotely into the browser, and all extension logic is bundled locally.
